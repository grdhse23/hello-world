My Intro
ðŸŽ‰   What a genious idea Github is,  love tech and love the earth.  Hope we can solve this climate crisis and I can learn coding.  Also relearning chemistry.  I enjoy tutoring Network + and am studying for my Cisco CCNA.  My interest is jamming programs into browsers and learning to write android and ios apps.  Taking frontend and backend code classes for beginners on treehouse.  One of my fav instructors is D Bombal on Udemy.    Cheers.  Hope everyone stays safe.

When i saw a project for a browser based version of cisco packet tracer I just knew github was going to take over the digital world.  Yes   Im so excited.  IM a baby learning networker / coder / cyber sec guy.   Just a baby but excited.  Thanks github for all you do.
